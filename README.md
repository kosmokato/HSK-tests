# HSK-tests.py
 HSK-1 test I made in python for studying and 4fun, gamificating the experience of learning a complex foreign language.

## How to use
loads the dictionaries from a CSV
```
{
	"chinese":"火车站",
	"pinyin";"huǒchēzhàn",
	"translation":["train station"],  # list()
	"Sentences":[]                    # list()
}
```
It picks one pinyin and three more random translations, showing on a menu.
Then the inverse: one translation first, and you can choose one of four pinyin words.
